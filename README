This is a tool to automatically download updated data directories from the Harvard FTP.

Usage
-----
1. Create a file in ./updated_files that specifies the updated data directories for the given version.
2. Overwrite download_versions.txt with the versions that you want to download.
3. Submit update_hemco.bsub (i.e., run "bsub < update_hemco.bsub" in the current directory)

Notes
-----
- The history of previously downloaded versions is appended to history.txt.
- Log files go into the ./logs directory.
